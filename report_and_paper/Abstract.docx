ABSTRACT:
SmartEdu+ is an AI-powered platform designed to predict student dropouts in educational institutions by analyzing academic performance, behavioral patterns, and socio-economic factors. 
Using machine learning models combined with explainable AI techniques (SHAP), the system identifies at-risk students early and provides actionable insights to faculty for timely intervention. 
The platform also offers visual analytics, detailed reports, and interpretable model explanations, ensuring transparency in decision-making. 
By integrating predictive modeling with user-friendly dashboards and feedback mechanisms, SmartEdu+ empowers educational institutions to proactively reduce dropout rates, enhance student retention, and improve overall academic outcomes. 
Preliminary experiments indicate that the system can accurately identify students at risk, enabling targeted support and informed policy-making.
